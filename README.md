# File Explorer - React + Redux + TypeScript

A fully functional file explorer interface built with React, Redux, TypeScript, and Styled Components. This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic and interactive file explorer with features like folder creation, deletion, renaming, duplication, and nesting.

---

## Features

1. **Folder Management**:
   - Create new folders with a right-click context menu.
   - Delete existing folders.
   - Rename folders by double-clicking on them.
   - Duplicate folders with a single click.

2. **Drag-and-Drop**:
   - Drag folders to reposition them on the canvas.
   - Drag folders into other folders to nest them.

3. **Nested Folders**:
   - Move folders inside other folders.
   - Explore nested folders by toggling their visibility.

4. **Context Menu**:
   - Right-click anywhere on the canvas to open a context menu with options to create or delete folders.

5. **Type Safety**:
   - Built with TypeScript to ensure type safety and avoid the use of `any`.

6. **Styling**:
   - Uses Styled Components for clean and modular CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: A state management library for managing global application state.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript for better developer experience.
- **Styled Components**: A library for styling React components with CSS-in-JS.

## How It Works

### Redux State Management
- The `foldersSlice.ts` file defines the Redux slice for managing folder state.
- Actions like `addFolder`, `deleteFolder`, `renameFolder`, `duplicateFolder`, and `moveFolderIntoFolder` are used to update the state.

### Folder Component
- The `Folder.tsx` component renders a single folder and handles drag-and-drop, renaming, and duplication.

### File Explorer Component
- The `FileExplorer.tsx` component renders the canvas and handles the context menu, folder creation, and nesting logic.

### Styling
- Styled Components are used to style the canvas, folders, and context menu.

## Usage

1. **Create a Folder**:
   - Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select "New Folder" from the context menu.

2. **Rename a Folder**:
   - Double-click on a folder to enter renaming mode. Type the new name and press Enter or click outside the input.

3. **Duplicate a Folder**:
   - Click the "Duplicate" button on a folder to create a copy.

4. **Delete a Folder**:
   - Right-click on the canvas and select "Delete Folder" from the context menu.

5. **Nest Folders**:
   - Drag a folder into another folder to nest it.

6. **Explore Nested Folders**:
   - Click the "Open/Close" button on a folder to toggle its visibility.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for files (e.g., text files, images).
- Implement a breadcrumb navigation system for nested folders.
- Add animations for folder creation, deletion, and nesting.
- Save and load folder structure using local storage or an API.
